    <p><b>Working Out -</b> I love to work out. I set a minimum of 40 minutes everyday to work out and get some exercise. I primarily like
        lifting weights, but have always been open to running or riding a bike (sometimes even swimming). I genuinely believe that
        exercise is the best form of meditation, and to at least have those 40 minutes in a hectic day, can go a very long way. 
        Reccommend 10/10!

    <p><b>Meditating -</b> I meditated pretty much everyday for 2 years. Do I feel like a monk? Not really. Do I feel calmer? Get Angry less? 
        can think through problems better? Yes, yes, and yes. Meditation is amazing, and I think is one of the best things you can do
        for your mind. If you feel as if you need some more structure, routine, or dicipline in your life, I would highly reccommend 
        meditation.

    <p><b>Video Games -</b> I consider myself nowadays to be a motivated individual in terms of my career and skillset, so it's a shame
        that I don't have more time for video games. My favourite game of all time is The Witcher 3. The story telling and overall fun
        of the gameplay is why it's critically aclaimed to be one of the best video games of all time.
